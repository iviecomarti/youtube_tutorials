# YouTube Tutorials

Hello everyone!

I am **Isaac Vieco-MartÃ­**, a biotechnologist and PhD student. This repository is a place where I share code that Iâ€™ve found useful, either in my academic work or in my personal projects. These scripts and tools aren't always essential, but they definitely make my life easierâ€”and I hope they can do the same for you!

### Why Share This Code?

I've benefited immensely from the work others have shared online, and this is my way of giving back. Whether it's code Iâ€™ve developed or just helpful snippets Iâ€™ve come across, I'm uploading it here in the hope that someone else might find it useful, too. I'll also be creating **YouTube videos** to explain the code in detail, showing you how it works and how you can use it in your own projects. Each video will be paired with the relevant code and resources in this repository.

### Geek Weekend Projects

In addition to research-related code, I might upload some fun personal projects I work on during my weekendsâ€”what I like to call my **Geek Weekend** experiments. These side projects are a way for me to explore new ideas and have fun with coding outside of my academic work.

### Wellcome!

Hopefully, some of this code can help  in your own work or projects. Feel free to reach out if you have questions, suggestions, or just want to discuss any of the code here.

Enjoy and happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
